# This file contains paths inside the distributions that should be ignored when applying the updates. Instead of replacing the
# old (blacklisted) files, new file with ".new" extension will be created. In case the file was removed in the newer version
# (but is still present in the distribution being patched), it will not be removed and empty file with ".removed" extension
# will be created.
#
# The blacklisting usually applies to configuration files, but can be used for arbitrary files inside the distribution. Known
# configuration files are blacklisted by default (see below).
#
# Add your own paths in case they are not covered by the default blacklist.

# Below is the list of files blacklisted by default. Please note that not all of these files are necessary part of the updates.
